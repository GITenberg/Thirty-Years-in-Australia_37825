description: Ada Cambridge had only been married for a few weeks when she set out
  for Australia with her new husband, a clergyman. Over the next several decades,
  the two lived and worked in a series of small, relatively rudimentary outposts,
  along with their growing family. This fascinating account of her transformation
  and acclimation to Australian culture will please fans of well-written memoirs.
